# 🎓 Student Performance Prediction (Machine Learning)

## 📌 Overview
This project implements a regression-based machine learning model to predict student final exam performance using academic and behavioral features. The objective is to demonstrate data analysis, model building, and evaluation in an end-to-end ML workflow.

## 📂 Dataset
Features used:
- Hours_Studied  
- Attendance  
- Sleep_Hours  
- Previous_Score  

Target variable:
- Final_Score

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  

## 🔍 Methodology
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify correlations
- Built a Linear Regression model
- Evaluated model performance using R² score and Mean Squared Error
- Generated predictions for unseen student data

## 📈 Results
The model achieved reliable predictive performance. Study hours and previous academic scores were identified as the most influential features affecting student outcomes.

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Apply advanced regression models (Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Perform feature scaling and hyperparameter tuning
- Deploy the model using Streamlit
